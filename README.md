# Optitrack basketball

Optitrack basketball is a python program used to plot animations of a basketball player (skeleton + ball), taken with an OptiTrack motion capture system.

The project is already provided with four takes of a basketball player doing basic movements, but other takes can be used, just adding them to the *filename* variable (in .csv format).
