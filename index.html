    <h1>Optitrack basketball</h1>
    <p>Motion Capture is a technology that enables movements to be captured in a digital environment, to achieve
        different purposes. For instance it can be used to capture the performance of an actor and make a computer
        generated character move, to pilot a humanoid robot or to study the performance of an athlete. In this analysis
        we are focusing on the latter example, trying to track different types of movements of a basketball player and
        his ball. This type of system could be very useful, in order to help athletes and their team to analyze
        movements and posture, allowing them to improve their performance and prevent injuries.</p>
    <p>In this analysis, the tracking of a basketball player is inspected. The results are presented in this site, 
        in form of images and animated gifs.
